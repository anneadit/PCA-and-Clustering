# PCA-and-Clustering

My Databricks notebook for this project can be found at https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/5441450466904902/2613930943288418/3150505834571580/latest.html

In this notebook, we will aim to group different species of flowers in the famous Iris dataset based on their physical attributes - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. We will first try to visualize the data in 3d using the Principal Component Analysis method to reduce the dimensions of the data from 4 to 3. After that, we will use the K-means clustering algorithm in PySpark to group the datapoints into clusters that represent different species of flowers. Information on the dataset can be found @ https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris

I have created this notebook in Databricks to get familiar with this system for big data analysis using Apache Spark.
